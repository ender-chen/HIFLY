uint64 timestamp_variance
float32 s_variance_m_s		# speed accuracy estimate m/s 
float32 c_variance_rad		# course accuracy estimate rad 
uint8 fix_type # 0-1: no fix, 2: 2D fix, 3: 3D fix, 4: RTCM code differential, 5: Real-Time Kinematic, float, 6: Real-Time Kinematic, fixed, 8: Extrapolated. Some applications will not use the value of this field unless it is at least two, so always correctly fill in the fix.
